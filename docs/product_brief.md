# PODStudio — Product Brief

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Design Specification

---

## What is PODStudio?

PODStudio is a Windows-first Python desktop application that streamlines the creation of print-on-demand (POD) digital asset packs. It bridges the gap between AI content generation tools and commercial marketplace requirements by providing automated organization, professional curation workflows, and one-click export of store-ready product packages.

## Who is it for?

**Primary Persona: "The POD Creator"**
- Creates AI-generated assets (images, audio, video) using various online platforms (MidJourney, SDXL, Suno, Kling, etc.)
- Sells asset packs on Gumroad, Etsy, Creative Market, or personal storefronts
- Struggles with manual organization, consistent naming, legal compliance, and professional packaging
- Uses mid-range Windows laptop (may lack dedicated GPU)
- Wants professional output without learning complex tools

**Secondary Persona: "The Batch Producer"**
- Produces hundreds of assets per week
- Needs fast curation (approve/reject/enhance) without per-file tedium
- Values automation and reproducible workflows
- May use cloud VMs (Colab, Azure) for heavy processing with remote access

## Why does it exist?

### Problems Solved

1. **Organization Chaos**  
   AI tools dump files into Downloads with cryptic names. Manual sorting is error-prone and time-consuming.

2. **Metadata Loss**  
   Generation prompts, settings, and provenance are lost or never captured, making iteration impossible.

3. **Curation Bottleneck**  
   Reviewing hundreds of assets one-by-one in file explorer is inefficient. No bulk operations.

4. **Technical Barriers**  
   Background removal, upscaling, format conversion require separate tools and technical knowledge.

5. **Marketplace Compliance**  
   Each platform demands specific package structure, licenses, README format. Manual creation is tedious and inconsistent.

6. **Hardware Uncertainty**  
   Users don't know if their system can handle intensive operations; tools crash or freeze without warning.

### Value Proposition

**"From AI chaos to store-ready packs in minutes, not hours."**

- Auto-organize downloads by type, theme, and date
- Capture and preserve prompts and generation metadata
- Bulk curate with visual gallery and one-click enhancements
- Export compliant, professional ZIP packages with all required legal and marketing files
- Safe execution with automatic hardware capability detection

## Core Capabilities (High-Level)

1. **Prompt Generation & Management**  
   Turn natural language briefs into platform-specific prompts; save with assets for provenance.

2. **Smart Ingest & Auto-Sort**  
   Watch folders, detect asset types, extract metadata, route to organized library structure.

3. **Visual Curation Workspace**  
   Grid view for images, scrub preview for video, waveform tiles for audio. Bulk approve/reject/tag/enhance.

4. **Professional Processing**  
   Background removal, upscaling (ESRGAN), video transcoding, audio normalization—all with progress tracking.

5. **Store-Ready Export**  
   One-click build of ZIP packages with README, LICENSE, manifest, store copy, and prompts folder.

6. **Hardware-Aware Safety**  
   Probe GPU/CPU/RAM; allow safe operations, warn on risky ones, block crash-prone tasks with actionable guidance.

## Success Metrics

- **Time Savings:** 10x faster pack creation vs. manual workflow (target: 30 min → 3 min for 50-asset pack)
- **Error Reduction:** Zero missing LICENSE or README files in exports
- **Adoption:** Users complete first pack within 15 minutes of install
- **Reliability:** <1% crash rate on supported hardware profiles
- **Satisfaction:** 90%+ approval on "easy to use" survey question

---

## Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Real-time AI generation (users generate externally; PODStudio organizes/packages)
- Multi-user collaboration or cloud sync
- Marketplace upload automation (manual upload required)
- Video editing beyond trim/transcode/upscale
- Audio mixing beyond normalization and trim

---

## Product Principles

1. **Windows-First:** Native desktop experience; stable on mid-range laptops
2. **Local by Default:** All data and processing local unless user opts in
3. **Fail-Safe:** Never crash; degrade gracefully; always explain why something can't run
4. **Professional Output:** Every export is marketplace-ready without manual fixes
5. **Transparent Workflows:** Users see what's happening, can cancel, retry, and understand results

---

## Go-to-Market Snapshot

- **Launch Platform:** Windows 11 (backward compatible to Win 10)
- **Distribution:** GitHub releases; optional PyPI for advanced users
- **Pricing Model:** Open-source (MIT) with optional paid cloud processing add-ons (future)
- **Support Channels:** GitHub Issues, community Discord, docs site

---

## Next Steps (Post-Design)

1. Review and approve all design documents
2. Set up development environment and project structure
3. Implement core data models and database schema
4. Build UI skeleton with PySide6
5. Implement watch folder and auto-sort (MVP feature)
6. Iteratively add processing pipelines and pack builder
