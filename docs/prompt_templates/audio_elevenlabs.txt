## Usage Notes

- ElevenLabs excels at voice synthesis, not music/SFX
- Choose voice model from ElevenLabs library or clone custom voice
- For POD assets, use royalty-free voices or ensure commercial license
- Keep scripts concise for sound bites (<30 seconds ideal)
- Specify pronunciation for uncommon words: `dragon [DRAG-on]`
- Use SSML for advanced control (pauses, emphasis)
