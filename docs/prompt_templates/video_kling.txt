## Usage Notes

- Kling AI works best with clear action descriptions
- Specify "seamless loop" for game/background use
- Keep prompts under 150 words
- Camera movement significantly affects output quality
- For POD assets, prefer "cinematic" or "realistic" styles
- Avoid too many simultaneous actions (split into multiple clips)
- Request "establishing shot" for scene-setters
