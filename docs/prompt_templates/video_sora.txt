## Usage Notes

- Sora-style models excel at realistic physics and motion
- Describe lighting explicitly for best results
- Reference real camera equipment for authentic look
- Keep prompts detailed but under 300 words
- For POD assets, aim for "cinematic" + "photorealistic"
- Avoid impossible physics (unless intentional)
- Specify "seamless loop" for looping backgrounds
